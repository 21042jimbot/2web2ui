# Code Coverage

To run tests and show code coverage, do:
```shell
npm test -- --coverage
```

This will run tests once (not in watch mode) and produce a coverage report in `/build-reports/lcov-report`

See the `jest.config.json` file in the root of the project for our test set up, including coverage config.
