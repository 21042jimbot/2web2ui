# Testing Introduction

This section of our docs is about how we test our code. We'll explain the types of testing we do and the tools we use to do it, as well as some examples of how to write tests for our most common cases. We'll also spend a little time talking about reasons for why you might choose one kind of test over another in certain scenarios, and some conventions we try to follow when we write all of our tests.
