# Cypress Testing Todos

As the team develops its testing strategy around Cypress, todo items have come up from time-to-time
that need to be tracked. For example, certain features could use additional testing, however, are
not currently feasible with the current Cypress feature set.

- [] Add tests for downloading CSVs once file downloading is added. See:
  https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/949
- [] Re-introduce failing tests that stem from tooltips that should be invisible when hidden. Will
  be doable once a new version of Matchbox is published:
