    If you cancel, you can send emails up to your monthly limit before your cancel date, but you cannot overage past that. You will not be able to validate email addresses using recipient validation. Any dedicated IPs assigned to your account will be unrecoverable after your cancel date and might be assigned to other SparkPost accounts.
