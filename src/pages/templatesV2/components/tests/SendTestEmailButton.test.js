// Test Cases üß™‚öóÔ∏è
/*
** The modal opening **
- The open prop on the modal is controlled by clicking 'Send a test'
- The `updateDraft` function fires when the modal is opened
- The modal renders the `<Loading/>` component when initially opened
- The `<Loading/>` component is no longer rendered when the promise resolves, rendering the 'To', 'From', and 'Subject' fields
- The 'from' and 'subject' fields render with data from the template content and are disabled when initially rendered

** The modal closing **
- The modal open prop is controlled by clicking the close button
- The form is cleared when the modal is closed - the 'to' field is blank, the email list is also blank
- The email error clears

** The 'to' form group **
- The submit event does not fire when the user hits 'enter' on the field
- If there are items in the email list and to `toEmail` text field is blank, when the user hits backspace the last item from the `emailList` is removed
- If the user hits 'spacebar' on the keyboard, no spaces are written to the 'to' field
- If the user enters an email address and hits 'spacebar' the email address is rendered as a tag, the text field clears, and any error is removed
- If the user enters an email address and blurs the field, the email address is rendered as a tag, the text field clears, and any error is removed
- If the user enters an email address, hits spacebar, and the email address is already in the list, an error is rendered
- if the user enters an invalid email address and hits spacebar, and error is rendered
- if the user clicks on the remove item button in an email list tag, then that particular instance is removed from the UI

** Submitting **
- if the `toEmailList` has no entries, the form renders an error
- If the form is submitted and there are emails in the `toEmailList`, then the form in the loading state
- If the `toEmailList` has a value, then the `<Loading/>` component is rendered and the `sendPreview()` method is invoked
- If the `sendPreview()` method succeeds, the `<Modal/>` prop `open` is set to `false`
- If the `sendPreview()` method fails, the `<Modal/>` remains open but the `<Loading/>` component is no longer rendered
