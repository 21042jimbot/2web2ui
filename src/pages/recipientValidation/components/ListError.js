    <h3>Oh no! There seems to be an issue with your list...</h3>

    <p>
      We're unable to validate your list as is, but here are a few ways to resolve some common
      formatting issues:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Try putting each address on its own line.</strong>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>You may need to clean up your list a bit.</strong>

        <span>
          All we need are the actual email addresses, no other information. If your list has extra
          columns or tabs, just delete those and re-upload a clean list of nothing but email
          addresses.
        </span>
      </li>
    </ol>
