# Access Condition Helpers

IMPORTANT NOTE: These functions are _only_ meant to be used with the Access Control components in this repo. They _cannot_ be used directly as selectors without first providing them with the "accessConditionState" which is provided by src/selectors/accessConditionState (there are a few account-related selectors in that file that make some of the account condition helpers available as selectors, as an example of how to do that).

For more on access control and how it works, see [the access control docs](/docs/access-control.md)
