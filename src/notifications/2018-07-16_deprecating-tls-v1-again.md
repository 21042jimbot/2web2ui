As previously announced, we are deprecating TLSv1.0, in favor of TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2. From Monday, July 23, connections to SparkPost APIs using TLSv1.0 will fail. This support article provides information on how to test your connections. https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/tech-resources/tlsv1-0-test-hostname/.
