After receiving feedback from our customers, we’re changing the way we calculate certain rates in the SparkPost UI. You can read the rationale and an outline of the specific changes in [this blog post](https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/metrics-calculation-update/?utm_source=notification-center&utm_medium=app&utm_campaign=all).

Note: this does not change any event data in the API via webhooks, message events, or metrics. These rates only appear in [the “Reports” section of the UI](/reports/summary). The changes will also be reflected in your weekly Deliverability Report Card in the next few weeks.
