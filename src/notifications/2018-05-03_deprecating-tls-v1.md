On June 30th, 2018, SparkPost will be [deprecating TLSv1.0](https://www.sparkpost.com/blog/tls-v1-0-deprecation) across all of our systems. TLSv1.0 is old and contains very severe vulnerabilities that directly impact the integrity and security of your communications.

**As long as connections are made using TLSv1.1 or later, this change will result in zero impact to your ongoing use of our service.**
