# Icon Button

Use the `<IconButton/>` component to create an interactive element that only visibly contains an
icon as a child.

## Usage

```js
import React from 'react';
import { IconButton } from 'src/components';
import { HelpOutline } from '@sparkpost/matchbox-icons';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const doSomething = () => console.log('something!');

  return (
    <IconButton
      onClick={doSomething}
      className="my-class"
      screenReaderLabel="Help"
      data-id="my-icon-button"
    >
      <HelpOutline size={22} />
    </IconButton>
  );
};
```

In order to use the `<IconButton/>`, import the component as well as an icon to use as a child.
