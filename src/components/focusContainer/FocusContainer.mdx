# FocusContainer

The `<FocusContainer/>` receives keyboard focus on render - especially helpful for dynamic UI
interactions that require additional guidance for screen reader users.

## Usage

```js
import React from 'react';
import FocusContainer from 'src/components/focusContainer/FocusContainer';

const MyComponent = () => <FocusContainer />;
```
