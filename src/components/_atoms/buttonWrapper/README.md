# Button Wrapper

The button wrapper component is used to consistently wrap groups of buttons in a visually similar manner. Vertical spacing is applied consistently via the CSS [adjacent sibling combinator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator) and the [universal selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors).
